      This challenge is addressed by combining Azure AD B2C API connectors, a
      custom backend, and claims customization. The API connector stores user
      role metadata either in an external database or directly in Microsoft
      Graph, and enriches tokens during the sign-in flow. A secure admin panel
      interacts with the backend to manage roles, while Azure Functions handle
      authorization logic and token claims injection â€” effectively mimicking a
      flexible PBAC system on top of Azure AD B2C.

      In this project's GitHub repository, you can explore two different
      approaches to solving this problem: one using a custom database, and
      another using Microsoft Graph directly. The live version of this site uses
      the Microsoft Graph-based implementation.
